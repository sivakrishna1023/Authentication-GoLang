# Implementing JWT Authentication in Golang

In this article, we will learn about implementing JWT Authentication in Golang REST APIs and securing it with Authentication Middleware. We will be building a simple, yet neatly organized Golang REST API with packages like Gin for Routing (mostly), GORM for persisting user data to a MySQL Database, and so on.

Topics covered:

- JWT Explained
- What we will Build?
- Gin Framework â€“ Quick Introduction
- Setting up Database with GORM
- User Registration & Password Hashing
- Generating JWTs
- Authentication Middleware to Valid JWTs
- Gin Routing & Grouping
- Testing Golang API with VSCode REST Client
